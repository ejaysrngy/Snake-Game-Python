# Snake Game - Python

A project from 100 Days of Code <br />
Tasked to make a snake game using Python code <br />
<br />
A basic snake game that uses the WASD to control the snake and steer it towards its food in order to grow in length <br />
Once it reaches a certain score it'll speed it up and make things more challenging <br />
<br />
The code was done with minimal hints, only stopped and referred to the videos regarding the logic of increasing the snake's length when it eats the food. <br />
